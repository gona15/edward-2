        <h2>What Des Moines Dentists Ask</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why trust a medical student over a local agency?</h3>
            <p>Local agencies charge $3,000+ monthly and spread attention across 50+ clients. I take maximum 8 practices, study your market obsessively, and have medical training to understand patient psychology. Plus, one failed client destroys my reputation - I can't afford anything less than exceptional results.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What if I'm not happy with results?</h3>
            <p>If you don't get at least 15 qualified leads in month one, you keep everything I build and don't pay until I deliver. No contracts, no long-term commitments. Results or refund, period.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How quickly will I see new patients?</h3>
            <p>Google Ads launch within 7 days of approval. First leads typically arrive within 48 hours. Most practices see 10+ new leads in the first 2 weeks.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Why not hire a big marketing company?</h3>
            <p>Big companies charge $2,500-5,000 monthly, assign junior staff to your account, and use cookie-cutter approaches. You get direct access to me, custom Des Moines market strategy, and pricing that's profitable for both of us.</p>
